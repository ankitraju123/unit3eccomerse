Explain about String, StringBuffer, and StringBuilder class with an example. Explain also
about toString() method in java.


1. String

String is primitive datatype.
There are two ways to create string
1. String str = "welcome...";    //method-I
2. String str = new String("welcome..");   //method-II

there is a little difference b/w both waysExplain about String, StringBuffer, and StringBuilder class with an example. Explain also
about toString() method in java.

1. String str = "welcome...";    //method-I
2. String str = new String("welcome..");   //method-II

there is a little difference b/w both ways
==> in method-I, only one object will be created in heap area of RAM
==> in method-II, two objects will be created in heap area of RAM.

2.StringBuffer v/s StringBuilder

Actually both are similar, the only difference is StringBuilder is more faster 
than StringBuffer.
You can use any of two according to your problem.


3.toString()

It is a predefined method which is belong to java.lang package.
This method is used if we want to convert object,array,primitive datatypes to string.
